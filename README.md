# Hogwarts Directory

## Description
A single-page directory application with data populated by The Harry Potter API [url][https://www.potterapi.com/]. The application's UI is broken into components, manages component state, and responds to user input. The user is able to sort the employees/characters by name.

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context
* An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
* Or, in this case, as Head of the Ministry of Magic, I would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other wizarding employees and search for them by name.
